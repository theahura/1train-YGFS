				YourGov.ForSale is an interactive visualization of the personal, political, and financial connections between the current American government and the Russian Federation. In an era of unprecedented chaos in the top ranks of government as well as confusion and intense hostility towards the media, YourGov.ForSale cuts through the noise to present a clearer picture of the data that is currently available.</p>
<p>
In the creation of this project, we attempted to stick to events that were easily verifiable, such as public meetings and statements, financial disclosures, or well documented personal ties. When an important and well reported connection was unverified, we included but clearly delineated the difference between the tenuous connection and more confident statements. </p>
<p>
We cannot help but note the complications in sourcing this project. Given the current climate, we knew up front the difficulty (or impossibility) of choosing well sourced information from reputable news outlets that were universally trusted. In part, we hoped to address this by focusing on stripped down, unpoliticized descriptions of confirmable events. While we have faith in the sources we relied on, we also believe in transparency. All of our sources are clearly identifiable and accessible directly from the graph*, and we encourage open (and civil!) discussion wherever this project may be shared. </p>
<p>
But hostility to media is not the only story. We also want to highlight the difficulty the average American may have in parsing modern political discourse surrounding Mr. Trump and his associates, and their ties to Mr. Putin and _his_ associates. The validity of the claims surrounding unprofessional governmental conduct with regards to a foreign sovereign entity - that too, a traditional (and, at times, over emphasized) rival in the global sphere - have deep repercussions for the American democratic experiment. We cannot emphasize this enough: whether or not these claims are real, they are important. In the last months, the American public has been inundated with stories of all levels of credibility tying the United States government with Russia. It has become extremely difficult to identify the larger picture and cut out exaggerations and falsehoods. The inability to discern truth is dangerous for a claim of this magnitude. By filtering information and providing a single point of understanding, YourGov.ForSale is a direct response to this problem.</p>
<p>
This story is not over yet. Even as this project was being developed, new claims gained traction and new connections - both plausible and silly - surfaced on social and regular media sources. We hope to continue playing a role in the conversation surrounding this story by updating the graph, cleaning up signals, and letting the data speak for itself.
